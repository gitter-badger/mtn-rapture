# Mountain Rapture
_Mountain Rapture_ is a game currently being written in Lua with the excellent [LOVE](https://love2d.org/) framework for 2D games, inspired by classic JRPGs and the "king in the mountain" motif found in literature and legend worldwide.  It tells the story of a hero returning to their people in a time of need.  _Mountain Rapture_ is thus far my most ambitious project, something that will probably take forever to finish.

## Status
As of this commit, _Mountain Rapture_ is in its extremely infantile stages.  No code has been written quite yet!

Current focus is on story and characterization.
