				<h2><i>Mountain Rapture</i></h2>
				<p>This is a game written in <a href="https://lua.org/">Lua</a> using a wonderful 2D game creation framework known as <a href="https://love2d.org">LOVE</a>, inspired by classic JRPGs with a story built out of a cross-cultural worldwide motif known in English as "king in the mountain", found in many folk tales, legends, and mythologies.  The story is based upon the return of a hero to their people in a time of dire need, making a grand effort to save them from their ill fate.  The working title, <i>Mountain Rapture</i>, is a direct translation of the German name for this motif, "<i>Bergentr√ºckung</i>".</p>

				<h3>This Site is a Mess!</h3>
				<p>The site's HTML and CSS is a horrendous mess.  I wrote it in one night to get it up and online.  Rest assured, it will be cleaned up!</p>

				<h2>Progress</h2>
				<p>Currently, I've got very little work done.  I've mostly been working on worldbuilding, particularly the setting at this moment in an attempt to provide a solid background and buildup for the ingame plot.  No code's even been written yet.</p>
